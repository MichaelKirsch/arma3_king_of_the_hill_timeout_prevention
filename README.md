# ARMA3 King of the Hill Timeout Prevention

This is just a stupid small script when you are too lazy to play for your XP. Just get some Rifle with Suppressor and get into a house
at the corner area of the AO. This script will lean to the side, shoot, reload at random times to pretend that you are still playing. 
Enjoy the XP.
